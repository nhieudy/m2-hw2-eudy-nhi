    <h1>Nhi Eudy - Hobbies, Interests, and Career Goals</h1>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        Some of my hobbies include:
    <ul>
        <li>Video Games</li>
        <li>Painting and Drawing</li>
        <li>Traveling</li>
        <li>And recently Boundering!</li>
    </ul>
    I've always been into Nintendo games and I have always had a PC to play games on. I've recently been playing more Baldur's Gate 3, as the story is really great! 
    I am still in Act 2, so I look forward to the development. I've also always enjoyed painting and drawing in my free-time - I love using aryclic paints, and I do use Procreate
    and Illustrator to draw digitally. I recently traveled to Japan and went to Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka. It was an amazing experiences, and I hope I can go again! I enjoyed the 
    scenary, the parks, food, and so much more. Lastly, I just recently got into bouldering and it has been a great form of exercise.
    </p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>Some of my interests have been taking daily walks, going to National Parks, antiquing, and collecting trinkets. Some of the National Parks we've been to Hot Springs, Great Sand
        Dunes, and Great Smoky Mountains. I have two mini Australian Shepherds named Pickle and Lemon! Here's a photo of them: <br>

        I've also been reading the second book from the 'The Way of  Kings' series and it has been good so far! You can also visit his website 
        <a href = "https://www.brandonsanderson.com/">here.</a> to learn more about his work!
        
    </p>
    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>I am currently an Electrical Engineer at the FAA. While I enjoy the work I do and I love my team, I would like to pursue a career where I can be more creative.
      I want to learn how to make various websites and applications, and I want to start building up my portfolio! I was able to learn Adobe InDesign and Photoshop last semester,
      and now I am learning Illustrator alongside this class. I am hoping I finish my graduate certificate, and I am hoping my Master's application gets accepted!
